### Project Name - Terrorist Activity Forecasting & Risk Assessment System

### Project Objectives -

**1] Terrorist Activity Forecasting**:-

The primary goal of your project is to develop a system that can forecast future terrorist activities. This involves predicting where and when terrorist incidents are likely to occur.

**2] Risk Assessment**:-

In addition to forecasting, your system will assess the level of risk associated with potential terrorist events. This assessment may consider factors like the severity of the attack, the likelihood of occurrence, and the potential impact.
