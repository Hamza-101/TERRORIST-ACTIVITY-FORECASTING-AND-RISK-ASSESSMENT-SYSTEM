## Introduction

Welcome to the **Terrorist Activity Forecasting and Risk Assessment System (TAFRAS)**, a project designed to address the critical issue of predicting and assessing terrorist activities. Our system leverages data analysis and risk assessment techniques to provide insights and predictions in the field of counter-terrorism.

## Motivation

The motivation behind TAFRAS is the increasing global concern about terrorism and the need for proactive measures to mitigate risks and respond effectively to emerging threats. TAFRAS is driven by the goal of making our world a safer place.

## Problem Statement & Objectives

**Problem Statement:** The world faces the continuous challenge of forecasting terrorist activities and assessing associated risks in real time. TAFRAS addresses this challenge by predicting and assessing terrorist incidents.

**Objectives:**
1. Develop a forecasting model for predicting terrorist incidents.
2. Create a risk assessment framework to evaluate the potential severity of these incidents.
3. Provide a user-friendly interface for users to access this information easily.

## Organization of the Report

This report is structured as follows:
- Section 2 presents a **Literature Survey**, including a review of existing systems, their limitations, and our contributions.
- Section 3 delves into the **Proposed System**, explaining our approach, architecture, algorithms, software, and hardware details, the code repository, experimental results, and our conclusions and future work.
